# mandelbrot set introduction

This project is a few years old but is certainly still interesting too me. I wrote it orginally in 2016 and just updated it. My original was writtn using an SVG, but this one is much faster using the HTML canvas. I based the functions on Borland Graphics. When I started programming I worked on a project that used that library for creating a UI. I actually ported it to Linux and integrated with the X11 graphics library to build native Linux application orginally wrtten for DOS and Windows apps.
